module Kata where

-- Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked
-- with implementing the line numbering.

-- Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each
-- line prepended by the correct number.

-- The numbering  starts at  1. The  format is  n: string.  Notice the
-- colon and space in between.

-- Examples:

-- number [] -- returns []
-- number ["a", "b", "c"] -- returns ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

-- | number
-- >>> number []
-- []
number :: [String] -> [String]
number = undefined
